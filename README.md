##  Welcome to IMDbc

Our IMDbc project is a Internet Movie Database (IMDb) clone. It's an online database of information related to films, including cast, directors, film abstract, official poster and comments or movie reviews.

The site enables registered users to submit comments / reviews, add movies to their personal watchlist, favorite movies and track all of their site activity.

## Core Goals:

1. Has user authentication with password stored securely
2. Provides ability to search for movies
3. Movies could be added to a watch list
4. Movies could be favorited
5. Movies could have conversations
6. There should be an activity feed
7. This information should all be viewable on a userâ€™s profile
